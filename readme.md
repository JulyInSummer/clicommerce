# Commerce CLI application

**_Originally this project was made by ZTM Dart tutorial course_**

The project simulates eCommerce app in the command line. It has list of products, cart and checkout.

## How to use?

To try this app by your own you'll need to download Dart or Flutter SDK.

1. _Clone the repository_
2. _Open terminal and head to the root directory of the app_
3. _Type ```dart bin/main.dart```_
4. _Try it_

## What's next?

I'm going to update this project and add these functionalities:

- _User creation and authorization_
- _Admin access_
- _Writing all information into files_
- _Logging_
- _etc..._
